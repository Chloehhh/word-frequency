GM, Ford see double-digit gains; 
But recall takes big bite out of Toyota's January sales

Toyota -- in the midst of an embarrassing recall -- posted a drop in sales in January, even as the industry overall showed growth in sales reported Tuesday.
The recall included a halt, beginning Jan. 26, in sales of eight of Toyota's most popular models until they are repaired for possibly sticky gas pedals.
Toyota sales, including Lexus and Scion, fell 15.8% compared with January 2009, Autodata reports. Toyota says it was its worst sales showing for the month since 1999. The industry overall registered a 6.3% sales gain for January from a year before.
The sales halt of the recalled models and bad publicity from the recall left sales 23% below Toyota's internal target for the month, Toyota-brand chief Bob Carter said. The recalled vehicles, including big sellers Camry and Corolla, constitute 60% of the automaker's inventory. Toyota's Lexus and Scion brands weren't part of the latest recall.
"Those who would like to come back are waiting," says Alexander Edwards, president of consultant Strategic Vision.
For the moment, potential buyers are content to make their old cars last longer until Toyota sorts out its troubles, he says. Toyota buyers tend to be security minded, so the automaker's safety recall strikes them extra hard.
By contrast, Ford Motor had a sales gain of 25%, General Motors saw sales increase 14.1%, and Chrysler lost 8.1% in sales compared with a year ago. GM, the largest seller in the U.S., said sales of crossover vehicles and passenger cars led its increase.
Ken Czubay, Ford's U.S. marketing vice president, said his company's retail sales to individuals were just "OK" for the month and that most of Ford's gain was in sales to government, corporate and rental fleets, which soared 154%.
Buyers took advantage of good deals in December and might have sensed incentives weren't as lucrative last month. It was harder "to get traction" with customers, he said.
Largely because of Toyota's troubles, GM and Ford were able to solidify their positions as the two best-selling automakers. GM had 21% market share last month, up from 19.5% a year ago. Ford increased its share to 16.7%, up from 14.2%. And Toyota fell to 14.1%, down from 17.9%.
Toyota officials said the priority right now is to get recalled cars fixed, not sales.
"We are focusing our full attention on jump-starting this repair process for customers," Carter said.

Toyota Recalls 3.8 Million Vehicles
DETROIT — Toyota said on Tuesday that it would recall 3.8 million vehicles because a floor mat could cause the accelerator pedal to become stuck. But for now, the automaker and federal officials are urging owners to simply remove their driver’s side mat while Toyota works out a solution.

The recall is the largest ever for Toyota, which is struggling for the first time with heavy financial losses and surplus production capacity amid a miserable car market in the United States. The recall includes many of the most popular Lexus and Toyota vehicles, including Camry sedans in the 2007 to 2010 model years, and Prius hybrid cars from 2004 to 2009.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration issued an alert on Tuesday about the Toyota floor mats based on reports that stuck accelerator pedals could lead to high speeds and deadly crashes.

“This is an urgent matter,” Ray LaHood, the transportation secretary, said in a statement. “For everyone’s sake, we strongly urge owners of these vehicles to remove mats or other obstacles that could lead to unintended acceleration.”

Until a solution is announced, owners of the vehicles should remove their driver’s side mat but do not need to visit a dealership, the company said.

This month, Toyota ordered dealers to inspect the floor mats in all Toyota and Lexus vehicles after a crash on Aug. 28 near San Diego killed four people; the police said the accident might have been caused by an improperly installed mat. The car was a 2009 Lexus ES 350 on loan from a dealership to the driver, an off-duty California Highway Patrol officer.

Toyota, whose largest recall previously involved about 900,000 vehicles, is still studying the matter before officially beginning the recall, but said it planned a broad safety campaign as soon as next week. Two years ago, the company recalled all-weather floor mats sold for some Lexus ES 350 and Camry sedans. The government said on Tuesday that it received “continued reports of vehicles accelerating rapidly after release of the accelerator pedal” even after that recall.

“The incidents appear to be related to factors including the use of a variety of unsecured mats, the particular configuration of the accelerator pedals in these vehicles, and the unique steps needed to shut off the engines in some of these vehicles with keyless ignition,” the traffic safety agency said.

The recall will include the following models: 2007 to 2010 Camry; 2005 to 2010 Avalon; 2004 to 2009 Prius; 2005 to 2010 Tacoma; 2007 to 2010 Tundra; 2007 to 2010 ES 350; and 2006 to 2010 IS 250 and 2006 to 2010 IS 350.

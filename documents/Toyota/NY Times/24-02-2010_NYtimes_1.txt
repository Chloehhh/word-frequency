Toyota to Foot Bill for Recalls
Toyota has agreed to provide free pickup and return of recalled cars, free rental cars or taxi reimbursement for the owners of the half million or so Toyotas in New York State that are being recalled, Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo said Wednesday. Soon after, a Toyota executive, Yoshimi Inaba, told a Congressional hearing that the company planned to offer the benefit nationwide.

“New Yorkers who own recalled vehicles understandably may be reluctant to drive their cars and assume the risk of harm to themselves and others on the road,” Mr. Cuomo said in a statement. “The agreement we have obtained from Toyota will help ease the fears of Toyota owners and protect their families at no cost to them.”

Toyota and its subsidiary Lexus have recalled millions of cars because of brake problems and other safety issues. Mr. Cuomo’s office has started a Web site, NYToyotaHelp.com, to provide information to Toyota owners about the help available to them.

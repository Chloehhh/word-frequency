Floor Mats Prompt Largest Toyota Recall
Updated Sept. 30, 2009 12:01 a.m. ET
Toyota Motor Corp. said Tuesday it would carry out its largest safety recall ever after reports that accelerator pedals had become trapped under floor mats, causing vehicles to speed up even after drivers lifted their foot off the pedal.

Toyota issued a safety advisory for owners of eight models sold under the company's Toyota and Lexus brands, urging them to remove the floor mats. The advisory, issued in conjunction with a similar warning by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, covers about 3.8 million vehicles.

"This is the largest action that Toyota has taken in the U.S.," a company spokesman said during a conference call with reporters.

Toyota said it needed to further examine the problems of individual models before issuing an official recall and that it would launch a broader safety campaign as early as next week.

The advisory follows a fatal crash in San Diego this month that prompted Toyota to order dealers to inspect cars for mismatched floor mats. Toyota officials said that accident was still under investigation.

RECALLED

Warnings were issued for the following models:

2007-2010 Camry
2005-2010 Avalon
2004-2009 Prius
2005-2010 Tacoma
2007-2010 Tundra
2007-2010 ES 350
2006-2010 IS 250 and IS 350
The executives didn't specify how many reports they have received about the problem with mats.

"This is an urgent matter," Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said in a statement. "For everyone's sake, we strongly urge owners of these vehicles to remove mats or other obstacles that could lead to unintended acceleration."

The Transportation Department said the problem appeared to be related to "factors including the use of a variety of unsecured mats, the particular configuration of the accelerator pedals in these vehicles, and the unique steps needed to shut off the engines in some of these vehicles with keyless ignition."

Warnings were issued for the following models: 2007-2010 Camry; 2005-2010 Avalon; 2004-2009 Prius; 2005-2010 Tacoma; 2007-2010 Tundra; 2007-2010 ES 350; and 2006-2010 IS 250 and IS 350.
